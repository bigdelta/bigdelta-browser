# metrical-browser

Metrical SDK for the browser.

## Installation

To get started with using Metrical Browser SDK, install the package to your project via npm, yarn or script loader.

### Installing via package manager

This SDK is available as a package on npm registry named `@metrical-io/metrical-browser`. You can install the package using npm or yarn CLI.

#### Using npm CLI

```sh
npm install @metrical-io/metrical-browser
```

#### Using yarn CLI

```sh
# yarn
yarn add @metrical-io/metrical-browser
```

Import the package into your project and initialize it with your API key.

```ts
import { Metrical } from '@metrical-io/metrical-browser';

const client = new Metrical({ writeKey: '<write key>' });
```

### Installing via script tag

This SDK is also available through CDN.

```html
<script type="application/javascript" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@metrical-io/metrical-browser/dist/index.iife.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
const client = new Metrical({ writeKey: '<write key>' });
</script>
```

## Track behavior
### Send Event
You can track an event by calling `client.track()` with the event name and its properties.

```html
client.track({ event_name: 'My Custom Event', properties: { my_property: 'property_value' }});
```
All events are sent via HTTPS.

### Page Views Tracking
#### Manual
You can track a page view event by calling `client.trackPageView()`. By default, 'Page View' is used as the event name, and the following properties are recorded:
- The page title.
- The page location.
- The page protocol.
- The page domain.
- The page path.
- The page query parameters.

You can always specify a custom name and add additional properties as shown below:
```html
client.trackPageView({ event_name: 'My Custom Event', properties: { my_property: 'property_value' }}));
```
#### Automatic
Page View events can be tracked automatically on every page load by configuring the `defaultTrackingConfig` during client creation (turned off by default), as shown below:
```html
const client = new Metrical({ writeKey: '<write key>', defaultTrackingConfig: { pageViews: { enabled: true }}});
```

To track dynamic page views in single-page applications, set the `singlePageAppTracking` option.

```html
// Only track when the path changes, disregarding changes in the query string or hash.
const client = new Metrical({ writeKey: '<write key>', defaultTrackingConfig: { pageViews: { enabled: true, singlePageAppTracking: 'path' }}});

// Track when the path or query string changes, ignoring changes in the hash.
const client = new Metrical({ writeKey: '<write key>', defaultTrackingConfig: { pageViews: { enabled: true, singlePageAppTracking: 'path-with-query' }}});

// Track any URL changes.
const client = new Metrical({ writeKey: '<write key>', defaultTrackingConfig: { pageViews: { enabled: true, singlePageAppTracking: 'any' }}});
```

## Identify users & companies
You can manage user identity through the `client.identify()` and `client.reset()` methods. Utilizing these methods correctly ensures that events are appropriately linked to the user, regardless of their transitions across devices and browsers.

### Identify
You can identify a user with a unique ID to monitor their activity across devices and associate them with their events. Once you have the current user's identity, you should call `identify()` as shown below, typically after they log in or sign up:

```html
client.identify({ user_id: '<user id>' });
```

### Reset
When your users logout you can trigger a reset method which will help reset the user identity. Weâ€™ll disassociate all future tracked events from the currently identified user.

```html
client.reset();
```
